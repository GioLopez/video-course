## Codecs and compression

Compression is the process of take a given input (can be a message, video, audio, files, etc) and transmit its content with less information. Depending on the application, this can support package loss or not.


When doing video compression it's really important keep a tradeoff between video resolution and bitrate, in the following example we have a comparisson of a screenshot from an original video and the same video, with the same resolution with lower bitrate, from 10 Mbps was reduced to 0.5 Mbps.

original    vs     0.5M bitrate

In conclosion we are trying to make fit a big picture of big resolution on a "small tube".

## Bitrate


## Framerate

### Framerate types

## Audio encoding

## Sample rate


## Deinterlacing
